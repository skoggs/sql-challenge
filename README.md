# sql-challenge

This is a sample sql exercise simulating internal employee records for a company. Included are a schemata (hackard_schemata.sql) and an ERD (ERD.png)
to describe and define the data into an SQL framework, as well as the data itself (in the form of CSVs in the Data folder). 

By loading said schemata and data into a database via PGAdmin4, the data can be queried for a host of different data and insights that would be difficult 
to see via conventional use of Microsoft Excel. Please consult hackard_queries.sql for some sample queries.
